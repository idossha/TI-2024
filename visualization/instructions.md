If you want to replicate the ROI with the atlas we use follow these steps:

---

Download the 05_HCP-MMP1 folder.

Place the .xml file in `path_to/fsl/data/atlases/HCP-Multi-Modal-Parcellation-1.0.xml`

Place the .gz file in `path_to/fsl/data/atlases/HCP-MMP1/MNI_Glasser_HCP_v1.0.nii.gz`

Run the following command to be sure orientation is okay:

```bash
fslreorient2std MNI_Glasser_HCP_v1.0.nii.gz MNI_Glasser_HCP_v1.0.nii.gz

```

The .xlsx file contains the names corresponding to the labels. Also, you could take the info from the .xlsx file and place them in the .xml for convenience.

Tip: When viewing in FSL make sure you use the 'big' labeling system.
