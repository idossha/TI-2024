#### Dependencies:

SimNIBS, FSL, Brainstorm, MATLAB, Jupyter

Brainstorm sits on top of MATLAB  
SimNIBS & FSL can be downloaded from their respective websites.

To create the conda env for simnibs: `conda env create -f sn_env.yml`  
To create the conda env for YASA: `conda env create -f yasa_env.yml `

---

p.s Remember that SimNIBS uses its own interpreter, so if you wish to run stuff from the command line..  
do it as follows: `simnibs_python your_script.py`

### Scripts:

1. **txt2csv.py:** will take .txt output from Brainstorm/EGI system and will put in a .csv format for SimNIBS to work with.
2. **csv2geo.py:** will take the data and format it to Gmsh language for 3D visualization.
3. **txt2mat.py:** will give you a .mat file compatible for Brainstorm co-registration.
4. **auto-charm.sh:** will run through all your ppt directories and run the `charm` function from SimNIBS to segment and mesh MRIs.

5. **fsl-pipeline.py:** take an MRI and will do the following:

   - a. reorient the scan using `fslreorient2std`
   - b. Extract brain using `bet` (this is still funky)
   - c. Perform linear tranformation using `FLIRT`
   - d. Perform non-linear tranformation using `FNIRT`
     The user needs to decide what template to register the tranformation to.

6. **extract-thrsh.sh:** creates a binary mask from an MRI scan.

   - Uses `fslmaths`

7. **leadfield.py** calculates the forward model for optimization / faster TI testing.

8. **TI.py** calculates TI field based on the paper from Grossman et al 2017. 

9. **gm_extract.py** creates a seperated mesh for TI field in the cortex.

10. **optimize_tdcs.py** lets you optimize montage based on HD-EEG with a variety of optimization methods:

    - Targets based on xyz coordinates / tissues
    - radius around target
    - Intensity and direction of field
    - Number of active electrodes

11. **SW_detect.ipynb** EEG processing.

12. **bi_polar** takes in two meshes of classic TI and calculates their modulation.

13. **TI_utils.py** this is a modification to the source code of SimNIBS that allow for bi/multipolar calculation.

### Want to make your life easier?

Make your scripts executable from anywhere by:

1. Add the Script Directory to Your PATH:
   The PATH environment variable tells the shell which directories to search for executable files in response to commands issued by a user. You can add your script’s directory to this variable.
   • Find the full path to where your scripts are located. For example, if it’s in /home/username/scripts, you would use this path.
   • Edit your shell profile file (like .bashrc or .bash_profile for Bash shell, .zshrc for Zsh) located in your home directory. Add the following line at the end of the file:

`export PATH=$PATH:/home/username/scripts`

Source your profile file to apply the changes without needing to logout or restart your terminal: `source ~/.bashrc`

**for Python scripts:**

Ensure your Python script starts with a shebang line pointing to the Python interpreter: `#!/usr/bin/env python3`

Make the script executable: `chmod +x /path/to/your/script.py`

Then follow the steps above.

---

To make your life even easier, create symlinks for all your scripts to a single directory like `/usr/local/bin/` so you do not have to move them from where they are sitting, and just add that dir to your path.
