This is where the finalizaed pipeline is being built.

As of July 19th, 2024 the process is as follows:

1. Use the charm function to create all the m2m_XXX directories. 

2. Place those directories in a parent dir with the scripts in `automate`.
3. Set up the `TI.py` script as desired. 
4. Run `main-pipeline.py`
